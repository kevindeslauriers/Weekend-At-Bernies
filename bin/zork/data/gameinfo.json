                "Welcome to \"The Shining: Overlook Hotel Adventure,\" a text-based journey into the heart of darkness within the walls of the infamous Overlook Hotel. Nestled deep in the remote mountains, the Overlook Hotel stands as a testament to a bygone era, its grandeur fading with the passage of time. Once a beacon of luxury and opulence, the hotel now lies abandoned and decaying, its halls haunted by the echoes of past guests and the restless spirits of those who never left.",
                "As you step into the faded grandeur of the lobby, you are drawn into a world of secrets and shadows, where every creaking floorboard and flickering light holds the promise of untold horrors. The Overlook Hotel has a dark history, stained by tragedy and madness, and you are about to uncover its darkest secrets. As you explore the labyrinthine corridors and forgotten rooms of the hotel, you will encounter ghostly apparitions, solve cryptic puzzles, and confront the malevolent forces that lurk within its walls.",
                "But beware, for the Overlook Hotel is not merely a place of haunting and horrorâ€”it is a living, breathing entity, with a will of its own. As you delve deeper into its mysteries, you will come face to face with the demons that dwell within, and the line between reality and nightmare will blur beyond recognition. Can you survive the nightmarish ordeal that awaits you, or will you become just another victim of the Overlook Hotel's insatiable hunger for souls? Enter if you dare, but know that once you step through the doors of the Overlook Hotel, there may be no escape from its dark embrace."
